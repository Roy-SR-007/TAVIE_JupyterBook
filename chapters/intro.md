**T**angent **A**pproximation based **V**ariational **I**nferenc**E** (TAVIE) for *strongly super-Gaussian* (SSG) likelihood functions which includes a broad class of flexible probabilty models: 

This is a `Jupyter Book` comprising of the implementation of TAVIE proposed in Roy, S., Dey, P., Pati, D., & Mallick, B. K. (2025). *A Generalized Tangent Approximation Framework for Strongly Super‑Gaussian Likelihoods*, [arXiv:2504.05431][TAVIE].
